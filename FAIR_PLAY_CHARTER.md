# Forge Universe – Fair Play Charter
*A commitment to competitive integrity and player trust*

## Our Core Philosophy
Forge Universe is built on the belief that **victory should come from skill, strategy, and creativity — not from the size of a player’s wallet**.  
Every player, whether free-to-play or a collector, should have an equal opportunity to compete, progress, and enjoy the game.

## Our Fair Play Principles

### 1. Skill Over Spend
All gameplay-affecting stats are **capped and balanced** so that no card or deck can dominate purely through purchase.  
Genetic traits influence *style* and *strategy*, not raw power.

### 2. Equal Access to Competitive Tools
Every card that can be used in competitive play will be **obtainable through gameplay** without spending real money.  
Rare and meta-relevant cards are **accessible through effort and skill**, not exclusivity.

### 3. Breeding With Integrity
**Rate-limited breeding** ensures that no player can flood the market with overpowered cards.  
Breeding limits are tied to **accounts, not just cards**, preventing pay-to-breed exploitation.

### 4. Fair Matchmaking
Competitive matchmaking considers **card power level and player skill** to ensure balanced matches.  
Tiered leagues protect newer players from facing advanced, highly optimized decks.

### 5. Transparency & Trust
Breeding odds, mutation rates, and balance changes are **public and clearly explained**.  
Balance patches are scheduled and openly communicated to maintain a healthy meta.

### 6. Cosmetic-First Monetization
Revenue comes primarily from **cosmetics, skins, alternate art, animations, and prestige items**.  
No direct sale of power, no stat boosts for cash.

### 7. Player-Driven Economy
The in-game marketplace is **peer-to-peer**, letting supply and demand set prices.  
Developers earn through small transaction fees, not by injecting overpowered items into the market.

## Our Ongoing Promise
We commit to regularly reviewing these principles with the community.  
If the competitive balance or fairness of the game is ever threatened, we will **adjust immediately** to protect the integrity of Forge Universe.
